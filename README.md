# Titanic Disaster Prediction

---

## Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is a tragic event etched in history. On April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, the supposedly "unsinkable" RMS Titanic collided with an iceberg and sank. The disaster resulted in the loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew members, primarily due to the insufficient number of lifeboats onboard.

In this project, we aim to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic survived or not. Utilizing passenger data, we explore patterns and factors influencing survival rates.

## Notebooks

### 1. Titanic_Scratch.ipynb

In this notebook, we implement Logistic Regression from scratch without relying on external libraries. By delving into the mathematics and principles behind Logistic Regression, we develop a predictive model for survival outcomes.

### 2. Titanic_Trees.ipynb

This notebook focuses on comprehensive data preprocessing and model selection. Leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, we explore various machine learning algorithms and fine-tune parameters to achieve optimal performance. The final model predicts survival outcomes with an accuracy of approximately 79% on the test dataset.
